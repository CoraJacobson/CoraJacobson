## 👋 Hi, I’m Cora!

I'm an iOS developer with a passion for blending logical, analytical thinking with creativity to build products that inspire, teach, support, or entertain. I like to make pretty things that do cool stuff!

- 🪴 I’m currently working on:
    - [Story Squad](https://www.storysquad.education/) - Story Squad turns "reluctant readers" into authors and illustrators in a wildly fun world-building game
    - [TimeTranslator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-translator/id1552304730) - the educational app I recently launched to the App Store with @Zachthac
    - MyTea - an app for the tea enthusiast which provides everything needed to log and use a tea collection
- 💬 My programming languages are Swift, Objective-C, and Python
- 📚 I’m interested in learning Server Side Swift in order to take a "full-stack" approach to iOS development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that allows me to further develop my skills and learn new things
