## 👋 Hi, I’m Cora!

I'm an iOS developer who has a passion for blending logical, analytical thinking with creativity to build products that inspire, teach, support, or entertain. I like to make pretty things that do cool stuff!

- 🌱 I’m currently working on:
    - [TimeTranslator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/time-translator/id1552304730) - the educational app I recently launched to the App Store with @Zachthac
    - MyTea - an app for the tea enthusiast which provides everything needed to log and use a tea collection
    - CitySpire - a one-stop resource for users to receive the most accurate city information
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Server Side Swift in order to take a "full-stack" approach to iOS development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that allows me to further develop my skills and learn new things
